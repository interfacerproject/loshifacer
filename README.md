### What is **INTERFACER?**

The goal of the INTERFACER project is to build the open-source digital infrastructure for Fab Cities.

Our vision is to promote a green, resilient, and digitally-based mode of production and consumption that enables the greatest possible sovereignty, empowerment and participation of citizens all over the world.
We want to help Fab Cities to produce everything they consume by 2054 on the basis of collaboratively developed and globally shared data in the commons.

* Analize all the git repository with the [osh-toll](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool)
* Secure communication with zenflows by using [zenflows-crypto](https://github.com/interfacerproject/zenflows-crypto)

- Install [osh-toll](https://github.com/hoijui/osh-tool) in the main root of this repository and [projvar](https://github.com/hoijui/projvar) in a folder inside you PATH.
- Modify .env.exmaple such that:
    * PATH_TO_RDF points to the losh-rdf folder
    * URL points to the web-page you want to ingest in
    * USERNAME, AGENT and EDDSA are your personal information
    * LOCATIONID is the location-id of the resources

Now you can simply start the ingestion using the following command:
```
# install dependencies
poetry install

# enviromantal variable
cp .env.example .env

# to perform a total ingestion
poetry run ingestion
# to perform a ingestion of new files in losh-rdf
poetry run cronjob
